Over the last few weeks I (CJ Marino) and Dylan Rafael (rrafaed) have been working on integrating the 
Candyland moon to lethal company. Due to the files we are using, and the fact they we are not able to 
commit them
to Github because they ar actual game files. We cannot commit anything except the final dll compiled file 
with our working mod. The porpuse of this text file is to highlight what we have workon on during these 
weeks 

    -  We have created a procedurally generated terrain, These moons are next to unheard of with very 
    little documentation on how to execute it, most of which is not realevant to Lethal Company

    - We have added a procedurally generating facility, located in different areas of the exterior of the 
    map. We also added precedurally genrated trees and candy items to make the game more replayable

    - Integrated these with existing lethal companies assets and made the mod playable on the base game

    - Modified the spawning parameters and conditions aswell as standardizing the ground position to
    account for the terrain being radomly generated

All of this comes with hours of debugging and hours of research required. The entire game takes roughly 3 
minutes to compile (this will not affect game play) so it takes a large amount of time to make even the 
slightest changes.

Addintionally we need to review each item that is modeled by the modeling team and make sure that the mesh
is reasonable and will not cause issues when adding it to the game.

    - This requires each blend file to be dropped into Unity to make sure it renders as intended, 
    especially making sure that the colors work properly
    - We also need to make sure that the mesh will not cause us to go over the mesh caps, since we are 
    generating everything proceudrally we had to calculate out the density of each object we added (worst 
    case and best case) to ensure that crashing will in theory be impossible due to too much mesh being 
    added. We wated to maximize the amount of ambience we can give the environment while not jepordizing 
    game play

What we are still working on:

- Shaders to make the moon look better while playing
- AI fixes of enimies to work with these new environments
- Integration of all of our models into the game
- Tons of bug testing in order to make the mod thunderstore ready

This mod is planned to be the cornerstone of our entire project but much of the work that we have put in 
cannot be put on GitHub due to it needing to be within the gitignore. We are currently predicting to have
the mod finished in time for the RCOS Expo
